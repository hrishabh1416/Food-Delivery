This is a full-stack Food Ordering Website that allows users to browse food items by category, place orders, and manage their accounts through a seamless interface. The platform supports user registration, login, and order tracking, along with an admin panel to manage products and update order statuses. Users can explore a categorized menu, add items to their cart, and view past orders through a dedicated "My Orders" section.

The user experience is enhanced with a responsive design featuring a dynamic navbar, visually appealing Explore Menu, and a clean, consistent layout across pages. Real-time updates and intuitive navigation make the site feel smooth and app-like.

The frontend is built with React.js using React Router and Context API for state and authentication. The backend uses Node.js and Express, connected to a cloud-based NoSQL database service, MongoDB Atlas, for data storage. Both frontend and backend are deployed on Render, ensuring a fully cloud-hosted solution.
